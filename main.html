    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity.</p>
    <p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Space complexity is often denoted as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> focuses on how efficiently memory is utilized by an algorithm.</p>
